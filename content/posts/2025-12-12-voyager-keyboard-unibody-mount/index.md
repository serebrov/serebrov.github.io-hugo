[Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager) is a nice compact split keyboard and it has a variaty of mounting options thanks to the magnetic case and the extra [magnetic mounting kit](https://www.zsa.io/voyager/tripod-mount) that ZSA also makes.

I had tripod mounts for a while and I use them for tenting, although in some situations it may be more conveninet to turn the split into unibody and thinking about my options, I found a nice solution.

The tripod mounts [that I use](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08Z8KX287) look like this:

I have two of these tripods as well as the the Voyager magnetic tripod mount. I removed the bottom part of one of the tripods (just unscrew the locking mechanism and take the bottom arm off) and replaced it with mountable part from the other tripod.

As a result, I can turn Voyager to unibody and also have an ability to rotate halves both vertically and horizontally, so both adjust tening and turn halfs at the convenient angle.

Here is how it looks:

There are also adjusment screws on the bottom, so halves can be moved closer or further apart:

If you wonder about the white dongle, it is [Handheld Scientific BT-600](http://handheldsci.com/kb), a adapter that turns wired keyboard into Bluetooth keyboard (besides the dongle, you also need a powerbank to power the setup).
