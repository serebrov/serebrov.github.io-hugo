The extension storage is not displayed under the "Application" tab in Chrome DevTools, but
it is possible to access the extension storage using a javascript console, here is how:

it is possible to access it via the javascript console:

* Open some web page, open Chrome DevTools
* In the javascript console, select the extension context (the drop-down with "top" in it)
* Use `chrome.storage.local` to access the local storage

The `chrome.storage.local` is a [StorageArea](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/#type-StorageArea) 
object and it has methods to get and set values.

We can also print the entire storage by passing the `null` to the `get` method
with `chrome.storage.local.get(null).then((data) => console.log(data))`.
