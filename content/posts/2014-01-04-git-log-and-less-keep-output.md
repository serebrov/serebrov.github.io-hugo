When `git` uses `less` as pager the output of commands like `git log` disappears from the console screen when you exit from less.

This is not convenient in many cases so here is how to fix this.

Just for git commands:

```bash
git config --global --replace-all core.pager "less -iXFR"
```

For `less` command, globally (including git) - add to your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc):

```bash
export LESS=-iXFR
```

<!-- more -->

Options we set for `less`:

* -i - ignore case when searching (but respect case if search term contains uppercase letters)
* -X - do not clear screen on exit
* -F - exit if text is less then one screen long
* -R - was on by default on my system, something related to colors
