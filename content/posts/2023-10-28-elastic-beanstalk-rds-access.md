I used to configure ElasticBeanstalk access to the external RDS database by editing inbound rules for the security group attached to the database.
This is inconvenient because there is always a risk of breaking something, especially if there are several environments accessing the database and we have multiple inbound rules.

A more convenient method is to use a "proxy" security group:

* Create a new security group named `rds-{database name}-access`
* Add this group to the RDS security group inbound rules, allowing access to the DB port (such as 5432 for PostgreSQL)
* Add proxy group to the ElasticBeanstalk security groups

The convenience is that we do not have to edit security groups anymore, we just add the "proxy" group in environment settings.

<!-- more -->

This can be done in the UI, by ticking the checkbox in the list of security groups or by adding a config like this:

```yaml
# Add to .ebextensions/app.config or as a separate *.config file 
option_settings:
  aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration:
    # Add environment to security groups that allow DB access
    SecurityGroups:
    - rds-db-name-access
    - rds-another-db-name-access
```
