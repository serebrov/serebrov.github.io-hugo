# Solving the frontend build out-of-memory error

If you encounter an out-of-memory error during the frontend build, you can increase the memory limit for the node process by setting the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable:

```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=8192
npm run build -- --mode production
```

Note that it should be enough to build the frontend application with the default memory limit. Increasing the limit is a temporary measure to be able to [profile and debug the build process](./html/2024-04-05-profile-vue-cli-service-build.html).

The error may look like this:

```
npm run build -- --mode production
...

⠹  Building for production...
